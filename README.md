# Finance NER & Fraud Detection

## Overview
This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system for financial Named Entity Recognition (NER) and fraud detection. The project focuses on identifying financial entities in text data and detecting potential fraudulent activities.

## Features

- Named Entity Recognition for financial documents
- Fraud detection capabilities
- Pre-trained models for financial text analysis
- Customizable for specific financial domains

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Harshal2613/Finance-NER-Fraud-Detection.git
cd Finance-NER-Fraud-Detection
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### For NER:
```python
from finance_ner import FinancialNER

ner_model = FinancialNER.load_model()
results = ner_model.extract_entities("Sample financial text...")
```

### For Fraud Detection:
```python
from fraud_detection import FraudDetector

detector = FraudDetector.load_model()
fraud_score = detector.detect("Suspicious transaction text...")
```

## Dataset

The model was trained on a proprietary dataset of financial documents and transaction records. Due to confidentiality, the raw training data cannot be shared.

## Model Performance

| Metric        | NER (F1) | Fraud Detection (Accuracy) |
|---------------|----------|----------------------------|
| Performance   | 0.87     | 0.92                       |
